# CSS-Tricks
A project where I am covering CSS

## Learning outcomes
* Understand how to use parent and sibling selectors
* Recognize the difference between pseudo classes and pseudo elements
* Learn about some of the most useful and common pseudo elements and pseudo classes
* Learn about the different ways to select an attribute or its parts

## Attribute Selectors
* [attribute] - This general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists. Its value doesnâ€™t matter.
* selector[attribute] - Optionally we can combine our attribute selectors with other types of selectors, such as class or element selectors.
* [attribute="value"] - To get really specific, we can use = to match a specific attribute with a specific value.
